<p>
This utility is based in part on the DASD utilities provided in TK3 and source code from HERCULES 3.07.
<br><br>
It is mostly for my own benifit.
<br><br>
It is written in Visual Studio C#. It uses zlib.net and some custom string, byte, and char extensions.

Requires the following NuGet packages:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* ExpTreeLib by Jim Parsells

<h4 align="left">Notes</h4>

<p>
This is still a work in progress. Initial testing was with TK3. Latest testing has been with TK4. It works well enough for my uses.
<br><br>
I left numerous debug and testing code in for anyone interested in making changes.
<br><br>
There are various improvements that I can think of. I will update this as time permits. But for now ...
